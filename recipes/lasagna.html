        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way
        to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you
        happy for days. </p>

        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite
        recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his
        college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna
        for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will
        easily serve eight people. </p>

        <h1>The Process</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crished tomatoes. The three kinds of toamtoes gove tyhe sauce great depth and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer whlie you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and permesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat this untill you have three layers and have used up all of the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat.</strong></li>
        </ol>
